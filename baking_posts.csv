So you tilled the soil, sowed the wheat seeds, waited for the wheat to grow, then you harvested and milled it in. You picked a wild chicken and domesticated it to receive its eggs. You proceeded to travel to Sri lanka by homemade boat to harvest cinnamon from the cinnamon tree itself by manually peeling the bark before grinding it into a fine powder. You then travelled to brazil by boat once again to reach the Brazilian sugar canes  where you found some, cut them down and crushed them to release the juice. You then boiled the juices to concentrate it and achieve crystallisation before drying the sugar. To get the white sugar, you boiled off all the molasses or rather very rapidly spun your sugar syrup in a homemade centrifuge (a sling and your arm). To get vanilla, you travelled to madagascar, once again, by boat, where you grew and harvested by hand madagascan vanilla pods approximately 8-9 months after pollination. You cut the pods carefully to remove the beans and proceeded to cure them by dipping them in hot water and leaving them to ""sweat"" befor eleaving them out in the sun to dry and mellow their flavour. After this, you placed the beans in a mixture of water and alcohol, the alcohol being ethanol which you acquired from yeast fermentation, and managed to get vanilla extract. You used everything altogether to create cinnamon buns in a fire oven you made using bricks you forged using clay you mined at a quarry you found and water at open fire using a stone mold you made using flint tools.

1k3x8na,My carrot trifle with Iranian-inspired carrot jam!! I finally have a recipe for it to share :),,46,2025-04-20 21:39:42,mo5nuwr,"**Recipe here originally: [Carrot Trifle Recipe](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/carrot-trifle-recipe/)**

I'm SO excited to share this recipe finally!!! I've made it several times and it's just a stunning dessert that I'm so proud of!!



**Carrot jam (moraba havij):**

* 5 cups freshly grated carrots (from about 10 to 12 peeled medium carrots)
* 4 cups water
* 1 cup sugar
* 10 green cardamom pods (lightly crushed)
* Pinch saffron (about 15 threads)
* 1 tablespoon warm water



**Orange sponge cake:**

* 4 eggs (yolks and whites separated)
* 1 cup sugar
* ¬º cup buttermilk
* ¬º cup orange juice (from 1 orange)
* 1 cup cake flour
* 1¬Ω teaspoons baking powder



**Whipped cream:**

* 2 cups heavy cream
* ¬Ω cup powdered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract



**For serving:**

* Edible flowers
* ¬º cup pistachios (crushed; or use slivered almonds)



**Make the carrot jam:**

1. Combine the grated carrots with water and sugar in a medium pot. Place the crushed cardamom pods in a small piece of cheesecloth and tie it into a pouch using kitchen twine.
2. Place the pouch in the pot with the carrots. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 hours, uncovered, stirring occasionally until the liquid in the pot reduces by half and the carrots are very tender and sweet. Turn off the heat and let it cool completely. Discard the pouch of cardamom pods.
3. Strain the excess liquid from the carrots into a small bowl and set aside. Transfer the carrots to another bowl.



**Steep the saffron:**

1. Place the saffron threads into a small bowl and crush them into a coarse powder with the back of a spoon. Add 1 tablespoon of warm water on top and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir the saffron into the bowl of grated carrots.
2. Refrigerate the carrots and the reserved syrup until needed. Be sure the carrots have cooled completely before assembling the trifle.



**Make the sponge cake:**

1. Preheat the oven to 325¬∫F. Grease the bottoms of two 9-inch cake pans or line the bottoms of the cake pans with parchment paper. Leave the sides of the cake pans ungreased.



**Beat the egg yolks:**

1. Add the egg yolks to a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick; they will increase in volume. This takes about 10 minutes of consistent mixing.
2. Add the sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the whole milk and mix until incorporated.
3. Sift the flour and baking powder into the egg yolks.



**Prepare the egg whites:**

1. Beat the egg whites until medium-stiff peaks form.



**Finish the batter:**

1. Fold the egg whites into the batter and stir gently until combined.



**Bake the sponge cakes:**

1. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Transfer to the oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until the sponge cake is firm to the touch.



**Cool the sponge cakes:**

1. Remove the sponge cakes from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Use a butter knife or a thin spatula to run around the sides and bottom of the pan to separate the cake from the pan. Flip the pan over onto a wire rack and lightly tap the bottom of the pan to release the cake if needed. You‚Äôre going to be cutting it up into bite-sized pieces, so don‚Äôt fret if it doesn‚Äôt come out perfectly!
2. Allow the sponge cakes to cool for at least 1 hour. Once cool, you can wrap them in plastic wrap until you‚Äôre ready to begin the trifle.



**Make the whipped cream:**

1. Combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Transfer to the refrigerator.



**Cut the sponge cakes:**

1. Cut the sponge cakes into bite-sized cubes and set aside.



**Assemble the trifle:**

1. Add half the sponge cake cubes to the bottom of a large trifle bowl. Add a few tablespoons of the carrot syrup on top. Add half the carrot jam on top. Spoon half the whipped cream on top of the carrots and smooth it into an even layer. Add the rest of the sponge cake cubes on top of the whipped cream and spoon a few more tablespoons of the syrup on top. Add the rest of the carrot jam on top of the sponge cake cubes. Finish the trifle with the rest of the whipped cream.
2. Refrigerate the trifle for at least one hour or overnight before serving.



**To serve:**

1. Right before serving, garnish the trifle with edible flowers and crushed pistachios. Spoon into dessert bowls and enjoy!",3,2025-04-20 21:42:32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3x8na
